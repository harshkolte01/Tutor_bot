# 2026-02-24 - Intro and Wrapper Implementation Explanation Document

## Task Summary

Created a beginner-friendly documentation file that explains the current backend implementation, with a strong focus on wrapper integration. The document is written in simple language for new developers and includes architecture and flow diagrams, implementation reasoning (why/how), runtime behavior, and short explanations of libraries used.

## Files Created/Edited

Created:
- `docs/Intro_and_Wrapper_ImplementationExplaination.md`
- `docs/2026-02-24_intro_wrapper_implementation_explanation.md` (this memory file)

Edited:
- None

## Endpoints Added/Changed

None (documentation-only task).

## DB Schema/Migration Changes

None (documentation-only task).

## Decisions/Tradeoffs

- Used current code as source of truth, not older historical summaries.
- Included both architecture-level and request-level flow diagrams in plain text so they render everywhere.
- Kept language intentionally simple and practical for a first-time backend learner.
- Documented implemented endpoints and clearly separated pending placeholder modules to avoid confusion.
